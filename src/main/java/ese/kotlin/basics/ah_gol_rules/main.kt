// Given the rules:
// 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
// 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
// 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
// 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

// Implement a function which determines if a cell will be live or dead in the next generation,
// given the cells state and the number of neighbors

// Write a main function which tests the implementation.
